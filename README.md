# final-project-Jianan_Ding

The theme of this project is to simulate a scene in Kubrick's movie 2001: A Space 
Odyssey, where the astronauts walk through the long corridor of the space station, 
and the black stone pillar in the middle symbolizes the black stone pillar that 
appeared in the movie. The person sitting in front of the stone pillar is moving the 
skull of an ape, symbolizing the evolutionary path of human beings from apes to 
flying into space.
